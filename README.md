# openRoomsProject
This project is to help me better understand HTML, CSS(Sass), and JS code. The point of this program is a tracker, the main points and functions I will list below in bullets to help outline the project
  - Use the mouse to click buttons to know what rooms and open or secure
  - Have a clock with DTG format
  - Track times that open/closed buttons were clicked
  - Have a drop down menu for notes about any changes to the room (Active, custodians, etc.)

Overall, I want this project to succeed, I only am making this because I want my first project to be something practical and unique. Doing challenges from Frontend Mentor is great, but making something from the ground up that can also be used for a implemented in a practical sense is even better.
